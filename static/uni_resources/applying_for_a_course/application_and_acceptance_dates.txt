 Application and Acceptance Dates

Understanding and adhering to key application and acceptance dates is crucial to ensure your university application process goes smoothly. Below is a general guide to help you keep track of important dates and deadlines.

 Application Deadlines

1. Undergraduate Programs
   - Semester 1 (February Start): Applications typically open in August and close in December of the previous year.
   - Semester 2 (July Start): Applications usually open in March and close in May.

2. Postgraduate Programs
   - Deadlines for postgraduate programs can vary significantly between courses and universities. It’s common for applications to open several months before the course start date and close a few weeks to a few months before the commencement date.

 Important Dates to Remember

1. Application Opening Dates
   - Check when the applications open for your chosen course and university. It’s advisable to start preparing your documents and application early.

2. Application Closing Dates
   - Ensure you submit your application before the closing date. Late applications may not be accepted, or they might be considered for the next intake.

3. Early Application Deadlines
   - Some universities offer early application deadlines, which can give you an advantage in the admissions process. Check if your university offers this option.

 Acceptance and Enrolment Dates

2. Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)
   - For international students, once you accept your offer, the university will issue a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). Ensure you receive this document in time to apply for your student visa.

3. Enrolment Dates
   - Enrolment dates are typically scheduled a few weeks before the start of the semester. During enrolment, you will choose your subjects, finalise your timetable, and complete any remaining administrative tasks.
