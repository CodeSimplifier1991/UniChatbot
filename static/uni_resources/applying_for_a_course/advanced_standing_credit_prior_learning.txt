 Advanced Standing and Credit for Prior Learning

When applying for a university course in Australia, you may be eligible for advanced standing or credit for prior learning. This can reduce the time and cost required to complete your degree by recognising previous studies or relevant work experience. Here’s a guide to understanding and applying for advanced standing and credit for prior learning.

 What is Advanced Standing and Credit for Prior Learning?

Advanced Standing: Also known as credit transfer, advanced standing allows you to receive credit for specific units or courses based on prior studies. This means you may not need to repeat certain subjects you have already completed at another institution.

Credit for Prior Learning: This recognises relevant work experience, professional training, or other informal learning. It can also count towards your degree, reducing the number of subjects you need to complete.

1. Previous Academic Studies: If you have completed studies at a recognised institution, you may be eligible for advanced standing. This includes:
   - Diplomas or certificates
   - Partially completed degrees
   - Completed units or subjects

2. Accredited Courses: Credits are more likely to be awarded for courses that are accredited and have comparable content and learning outcomes to the subjects in your chosen degree.

 Eligibility for Credit for Prior Learning

1. Relevant Work Experience: Professional experience in a related field may be recognised as credit towards your degree. This includes:
   - Employment history
   - Professional development or training
