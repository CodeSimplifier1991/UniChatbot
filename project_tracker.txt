In this file, I aligned the steps it has been taken to create this application.

Initial Version:
Created a general application with basic functionality that the user can click on any button and the app generates 
some content by reading the content from a file defined in the project.
For example when the user clicks on the 'General Entry Requirements', the app reads the file named 'general_entry_requirements.txt' file
and responds to the user request.
At the end of each request, the app asks the user wether they need more help on anything else or not.
If the user input is not defined, they will receive an error message indicating the bot doesn't have the data to respond to the request.
