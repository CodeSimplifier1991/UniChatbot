 University Fees and Costs Overview

 Domestic Students

Tuition Fees
Domestic students enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) will have their tuition fees subsidised by the Australian Government. The remaining amount, known as the student contribution, varies depending on the course of study. For example:

- Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences: Approximately $6,000 - $7,000 per year.
- Business and Commerce: Approximately $10,000 - $11,000 per year.
- Science and Engineering: Approximately $8,000 - $9,000 per year.
- Education and Nursing: Approximately $4,000 - $5,000 per year.

These amounts are subject to change based on government policy and university regulations.

Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)
All domestic students are required to pay a Student Services and Amenities Fee, which supports services such as sporting facilities, health and welfare, and student representation. The SSAF is typically around $300 per year.

HECS-HELP Loan
Eligible domestic students can defer their tuition fees through the HECS-HELP loan scheme. This loan covers the student contribution amount and is repaid through the Australian taxation system once the student’s income reaches a certain threshold.

 International Students

Tuition Fees
International students are required to pay full tuition fees for their courses. These fees vary depending on the degree and area of study. Indicative annual fees for some popular courses are:

- Bachelor of Arts: $30,000 - $35,000 per year.
- Bachelor of Business: $32,000 - $37,000 per year.
- Bachelor of Science: $35,000 - $40,000 per year.
- Bachelor of Engineering: $38,000 - $43,000 per year.
- Bachelor of Information Technology: $33,000 - $38,000 per year.

Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)
International students must have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the duration of their stay in Australia. The cost of OSHC varies depending on the length of coverage and the provider, averaging around $500 - $600 per year for a single student.

Other Costs
International students should also budget for other living expenses, including accommodation, food, transport, and personal costs. The estimated cost of living in Australia ranges from $20,000 to $25,000 per year, depending on lifestyle and location.

 Scholarships and Financial Assistance

Domestic Students
A variety of scholarships are available for domestic students based on academic merit, financial need, and other criteria. These scholarships can help reduce the overall cost of study. Additionally, some students may be eligible for government allowances such as Youth Allowance or Austudy.

International Students
The university offers a range of scholarships for international students to support their studies. These scholarships are awarded based on academic excellence, leadership qualities, and other achievements. Information on available scholarships and application processes can be found on the university’s website.

 Payment Deadlines and Methods

Students must ensure their fees are paid by the specified deadlines to avoid penalties or restrictions on enrolment. Payments can be made via various methods, including online banking, credit card, or direct debit.

 Refund Policy

The university has a clear refund policy for both domestic and international students. If a student withdraws from a course before the census date, they may be eligible for a full or partial refund of tuition fees. Specific details of the refund policy can be accessed through the university’s student services department.

Understanding the fees and costs associated with university study is crucial for effective financial planning. The university provides comprehensive support and resources to help students manage their finances throughout their academic journey.
